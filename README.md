# js-practice

This repository lists all the javascript projects that I'm practising when learning MIT MERN Full Stack course.

You can view index.html for the list of demonstrations.

The projects have been added following the order of learning sequence, 
related to basic data types, data structures, control statements, loops, object oriented programming etc.
